<h1><strong>Open hardware for quantum technology</strong></h1>
<br>
<p>First edit: October 16, 2020. Last updated: April 1, 2021.</p>

<br>
<br>
<p><strong>Open hardware beyond quantum</strong></p>
<p>Imagine having the blueprint to construct your quantum computer: that&rsquo;s an example of quantum open hardware. In the classical world, examples like Arduino and Raspberry Pi have popularized the open hardware movement. There are non-profit organizations backing such ecosystem endeavors, for example the <a href="https://fossi-foundation.org/">Free and Open Source Silicon (FOSSi) </a>foundation supports hobbyists and academics and the <a href="https://www.opencompute.org/">Open Compute Project</a> counts industry members like Facebook, IBM, Intel, Google, Microsoft, and others.</p>
<p><strong>Trends around open quantum hardware</strong></p>
<p>There are a couple of different aspects that one can think of as &ldquo;open hardware&rdquo; in quantum technology. Here is a list with a few categories:.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Blueprints and tooling for hardware design and manufacture.&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>A good example is, <a href="https://pyepr-docs.readthedocs.io/">pyEPR</a>, a Python package for designing quantum processors out of superconducting circuits Originally developed at Yale, it is now used by tens of research groups in Northern America, Europe, and beyond. IBM is building upon this, integrating pyEPR as a plugin for their <a href="https://qiskit.org/metal/">Qiskit Metal</a> platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tackling another set of issues experimentalists find in the lab, <a href="https://scqubits.readthedocs.io/">`scqubits`</a> is a Python package, integrated with <a href="http://qutip.org/">QuTiP</a>, which allows users to predict the energy landscape of superconducting qubits, mainly flux qubits, based on properties of the circuit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, open foundries seem to still be missing from the world map in quantum science and technology.&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>From remotely-controlled laboratories to a testbed infrastructure</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Chris Monroe&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01937-x">article</a> recently highlighted that they never took as good data in experiments as during the pandemic, since labs and campus were closed and in optimal experimental conditions. However, the first to provide durable and maintained open-access to their resources have come from the private sector, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rigetti/">Rigetti</a>&rsquo;s and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/quantum-computing/">IBM</a>&rsquo;s cloud-based quantum computing infrastructure have provided some of the most durable examples, which have been used by theoretical and experimental researchers around the world. </li>
<li>ColdQuanta's <a href="https://www.coldquanta.com/news/coldquanta-announces-quantum-matter-on-the-cloud/">Albert</a> provides a Bose Einstein Condensate controlled from the cloud.</li>
<li>More recently, quantum computing hardware companies are more and more opting for leveraging Big Tech&rsquo;s infrastructural know-how in cloud architecture to just provide end-points to their quantum processors. Honeywell through Microsoft&rsquo;s Azure, IonQ on AWS&rsquo;s BraKet and Azure, and now Rigetti too seems to focus more and more on the hardware stack, while the high-end access is provided through BraKet.</li>
</ul>
<p>Academic institutions are now following up, by stepping up the game and even creating an infrastructure for testbeds, involving quantum computing, quantum simulation, and in the future, tests on the rudimental network connectivity:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.quantum-inspire.com/">Quantum Inspire</a> at TUDelft in the Netherlands provides access to both superconducting and quantum-dot-based spin qubits.</li>
<li>In the USA, national labs are leading the academic infrastructure, providing testbeds for the research community, such as at Sandia National Labs through the <a href="https://www.sandia.gov/quantum/Projects/QSCOUT.html">QSCOUT</a> program or at Lawrence Berkeley&rsquo;s Lab <a href="https://aqt.lbl.gov/">AQT</a> one. </li>
<li>There are plans for the European OpenSuperQ to open access to researchers.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this context, it is also interesting to see the interplay between high-performance supercomputing centers and quantum computing providers.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>3<strong>. Automating processes in the labs, as in data acquisition</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Several academic labs are adding code to github, either on private or public repositories. This open-source software interfaces with hardware in the lab. Open source drivers and controllers help researchers avoid hefty overheads of proprietary software, support open customization, and are implemented for quantum tech specific use cases. A good example is <a href="http://qcodes.github.io/Qcodes/">QCodes</a>, a Python-based data acquisition framework developed at research centers in Copenhagen, Delft, Sydney, and at Microsoft Research. </p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>HW/SW Co-design: Quantum technologies &lsquo;close to the metal&rsquo;</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>There are technical reasons why open-hardware is important: in noisy quantum computers algorithms often need to run &ldquo;closer to the metal&rdquo;. An open source approach for the higher level software stack prompts co-design principles for hardware too. Software could perform better if it is informed about hardware specifics: as Alan Kay noted, and famously quoted by Steve Jobs &ldquo;People who are really serious about software should make their own hardware&rdquo;, a <strong><em>co-design</em></strong> principle that is ever more important in the context of quantum devices, whose performance can be limited by elements such as qubit connectivity, fast feedback in classical control, and where processors look very different depending on the technology used.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this context, an open-hardware framework can extend beyond hardware specs and spill over into software tools that enhance the level of control of the hardware. Examples of this include pulse-level control of quantum processors, beyond the discrete, instruction-based intermediate representation provided by quantum gates. Some notable examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>IBM researchers and collaborators have proposed a standard, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2019/12/qiskit-openpulse/">OpenPulse</a>, akin to what they did for quantum circuits&rsquo; intermediate representation with OpenQasm. Currently, the features designed for IBM&rsquo;s quantum processors are implemented in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06755">Qiskit Pulse</a>.&nbsp;</li>
<li>&nbsp;Researchers at Julich and in Delft, with collaborators, have developed qupulse, a software specifically designed to implement pulse-level control of quantum spins in the lab.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Pasqal&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/pasqal-io/Pulser">Pulser</a> leverages QuTiP to provide laser pulse-level simulation of their Rydberg atom-based processors.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Open-source software for hardware characterization and optimization</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Along this line, all the research performed in quantum optimal control, noise calibration, and more recently, error mitigation, has a side that is amenable to extend hardware into open-software. A very recent example in optimal control is <a href="https://github.com/goroda/c3sc">C3CS</a>, an optimal control software developed mainly at Julich within the framework of the EU&rsquo;s quantum computers, OpenSuperQ, which has an attention to open accessibility. An example in quantum error mitigation is instead <a href="https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/">Mitiq</a>, the open source software being developed at Unitary Labs, the R&amp;D arm of Unitary Fund, which, being completely hardware-agnostic, can provide customizations with tight integration with specific executors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- NIST (National Institute for Standard and Time), has developed <a href="https://github.com/m-labs/artiq">ARTIQ</a>, which stands for Advanced Real-Time Infrastructure for Quantum physics, now maintained by M-Labs. It is a software that provides fast control for trapped ions enhanced by the use of FPGAs.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tracking the development of open quantum hardware</strong></p>
<p><strong>Unitary Fund&rsquo;s mission</strong></p>
<p>At Unitary Fund we&rsquo;re excited by open-source software projects. You can see the many we&rsquo;ve supported <a href="https://unitary.fund/grants.html">here</a>. We&rsquo;re also excited by the possibility of helping more open-hardware projects and their communities, such as for PyEPR, for which Zlatko Minev has been organizing the first developers meetup, and to which we were glad to be invited to speak.</p>
<p>If you work on a quantum open-hardware project and think a Unitary Fund micro-grant may help your mission, <strong>please consider applying</strong>: there are no strings attached. Here there is a collaborative repository where everyone can add projects that belong to open-hardware. For open-source software projects in quantum computing, there is the excellent repository by the Quantum Open Source Foundation, with the <a href="https://github.com/qosf/awesome-quantum-software"><em>awesome</em></a> repository, which includes experimental quantum computing packages.</p>
<p>A preliminary list of projects is already added to this <a href="https://github.com/nathanshammah/open-quantum-hardware"><strong>open-quantum-hardware</strong></a><strong> list</strong>, it would be great to have more added from the community, by opening a pull request or editing this blog <a href="https://github.com/unitaryfund/unitary-fund/">post</a>.</p>
